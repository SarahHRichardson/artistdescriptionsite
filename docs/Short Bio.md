# Shorter Statement About Juan Diego's Art

Juan Diego Perez la Cruz is a photographer, artist, and educator. He was born in 1986, in Maracaibo, Venezuela – near Columbia. 

Juan Diego uses his art to capture and discuss themes that are important to him. 

Juan Diego reflects his culture and love of his homeland with his photographic representation of Venezuelan politics. Calle Venezuela 1-4500 (Venezuela’s Streets 1-4500) brings inside – Juan Diego’s family photographs – to outside – the many streets in Venezuela – in a way that truly represents the country.

Experiencing so many different cultures through his residencies led to Juan Diego’s lasting interest in memory, particularly in the relationship between personal and cultural memory. He expressed this early in his career through Serie Memoria Privada (in English, Series of Private Memories), and later in his career through Las Armas Nos Escudan (The Weapons that Shield Us). Both pieces have tie-ins to his exploration of politics.

Juan Diego is also interested in exploring the juxtaposition between inside (Juan Diego and his personal spaces, such as his studio) and outside (the space that Juan Diego interacts with but does not control). Several of Juan Diego’s recent projects, such as Como Construir Un Monumento (How to Construct a Monument), revolve around everyday ways that a person can control an outside space. 
Another focus of Juan Diego’s art is the human body – both his own and other people’s. Himno Nacional de Venezuela (Venezuelan National Anthem) depicts Juan Diego as both the artist and subject of his own work as he uses his body to comment on the state of Venezuela.
