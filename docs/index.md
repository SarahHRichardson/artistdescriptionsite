# Serpentina Arts Static Website

Hello and welcome to my static website to chronicle and discuss Page 1 of the Serpentina Arts project. 

I am working with photographer Juan Diego Perez la Cruz to create an artist bio for him to use when pursuing job opportunities.

I used various pages to seperate my content.

* The [*Project Overview*](Overview.md) tab contains an employer-friendly desciption of the Serpentina Arts Project.
* The [*Interview Process*](Preparation.md) tab contains the script and interview questions that I prepared for my interview. I also linked the meeting recording and transcription.
* The [*Biography Draft*](Draft Bio.md) tab contains my first draft of my biography for Juan Diego.
* The [*Biography Final*](Long Bio.md) tab contains my final draft of Juan Diego's biography.
* The [*Short Statment Final*](Short Bio.md) tab contains a full statment about Juan Diego's artwork, which I reduced to fit into his artist biography.
