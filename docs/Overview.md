# Introduction to the Serpentina Arts Project Collab

Serpentina Arts is an organization for Latin American artists working in the twin cities. The group was created in 2019. Members use a variety of styles and media to create art.

As an activity in the class Writing With Digital Technologies (Writ4662W), class members are partnering with an artist in Serpentina Arts to help them create an artist biography.

Elements of the project include interviewing the artists, transcribing the interviews, drafting various biographies and working with the artist to edit and perfect the materials.
