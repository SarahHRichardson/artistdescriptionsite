### Preparing for the Interview

To prepare for my interview, I looked through Juan Diego's art portfolio and instagram page. I used these resources to draft a list of questions to ask during the interview. I then drafted a short script for before and after the interview.

### Interview Script and Question List

#### Script for Before the Interview

Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me! I really, really appreciate it. Is it okay that I am recording the interview for school assignment and note-taking purposes? Also, if you would rather not answer my questions, or you think of another question you want me to ask, please let me know!
*Note: check that I am recording to the cloud and I selected Live Script*
